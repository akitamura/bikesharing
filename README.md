### Summary

This is a small test of tableau to become familiar with the visualization tool. Data from citibike was used to observe different attributes to get a brief understanding of how citibike worked within New York City. This information was then used to compare to data in the city of Des Moines for a possible startup in the city. 

#### Citibike to Des Moines

To tell if we can create a similar format of CitiBike in Des Moines, we compared the population of Des Moines to New York City. First thing that we noticed is that NYC's population is significantly larger than that of Des Moines. Des Moines has a population of 214,237 while 8,335,817. That makes the population of Des Moines roughly 3 percent of New York City's population. On that note, the diversity of Gender is roughly the same between the two cities, both around 50%. What is interesting is that Des Moines has a larger percent of it's population under 18yrs and a smaller percent of it's population of 65yrs and older. Des Moines' population's mediaun household income is about $8,500 lower than New York City's population. The city of Des Moines' population density is also smaller by over 25,000 people per square mile.

Next we looked at the different McDonald's locations between both cities. Overall New York City has more McDonalds than Des Moines. Per the maps listed on the presentation, the density is also higher per square mile in New York City than that of Des Moines. It should be noted that the majority of McDonalds, are concentrated near the Manhattan island area than the more evenly destributed area of Des Moines.

After comparing the two cities, using information from New York City, the usage of CitiBike was attempted to be forcasted in Des Moines. It was forcasted, that if CitiBIke was to be used at the same frequency as that of New York City, Des Moines could expect about 60,240 uses per month. The majority of customers would expected to be subscribers, and that the gender of users would be predominately male. This information could be useful to find other avenues of making a CitiBike style a success. This would also be helpful in marketing towards a specific customer type. A breakdown of usage per birth year also noted that users tended to be younger. Specifically users born post 1970. Again helping to target a specific customer.

Lastly, it was observed that Des Moines, per it's Metropolitan Plannign Organization did have an expansive bike trail system. This bike trail would lead to various parts in the city as paved routes and various parks via both paved and trail roads. This means that though the population is smaller than that of New York City, Des Moines has and advantage of being open for a biking community.
